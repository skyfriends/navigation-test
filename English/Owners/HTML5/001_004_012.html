          </h3>
          <p>Each extruder system features two emergency stop (E-Stop) pushbuttons. One is on the control room console and the
            other is on a small control panel located near the extruder downspout. These pushbuttons have large red actuator
            heads. E-Stop is activated by pushing the red actuator head down (it should lock in place). E-Stop is deactivated
            by twisting the red actuator head until it pops back up.
          </p>
          <p>Either E-Stop pushbutton will terminate output power from the
            <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to all extruder system electrical equipment. Outputs signals from the
            <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to all motors, valves, and flow control devices will be interrupted. These devices cannot be energized
            while the E-Stop pushbutton remains in the down position.

          </h3>
          <p>Each extruder system features two manual downspout bypass switches. One is on the control room console and the
            other is on a small control panel located near the extruder downspout. Either of these two switches will allow
            the operator to reposition the downspout from channeling preconditioner effluent into the extruder inlet. These
            switches are ignored when the downspout is already in the bypass position.

            <span class="chapter-number">4.12.3</span> Changing the Knife Speed
          </h3>
          <p>A switch is mounted on the knife stand for controlling the knife speed. This switch can be used to both increase
            and decrease the knife speed. The switch can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise from its middle (off) position,
            but when released will always return to its off position. Rotating and holding the switch counterclockwise will
            cause the knife speed to slowly ramp up, while rotating and holding the switch clockwise will cause the knife
            speed to slowly ramp down.

            <span class="chapter-number">4.12.4</span> Recovering from Excessive Extruder Motor Load
          </h3>
          <p>If the extruder motor load or the conehead pressure exceeds their respective high alarm limit value for a configured
            period of time, the
            <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will initiate the overload recovery routine in an attempt to lower the load. The extruder water setpoint
            will be increased by 1%, the downspout will divert to reject then back to the extruder 3 times. If the load remains
            high through all these corrective actions, the
            <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will initiate a quick shutdown. If these measures are effective in decreasing the load the extruder
            will continue to run. The 1% additional water is removed upon acknowledgement and clearing of the alarm. When
            the alarm condition is corrected and the operator has acknowledged the alarm the 1% water will automatically
            be removed.
