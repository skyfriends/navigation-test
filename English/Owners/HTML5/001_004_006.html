               </h2> 
               <p>To initiate an <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>-managed extruder system normal shutdown, the operator brings up the Overview screen
                  on the control room <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console, clicks the “(F5) Extruder Commands” button, and on the Commands Menu dialog
                  box that appears, clicks the “Normal Shutdown” button. The normal shutdown sequence
                  of operations that the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> executes are listed below in the order that they take place.
               </p> 
               <ol>
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> displays the system status in the upper left corner of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor “Stopping Extruder.”
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> ceases refilling the surge bin and live bin if they are at or below low level.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> increases the flow rate of process water to the extruder by the same formula value
                     of extra extruder water for startup.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> stops the screw feeder. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> also causes a button with the caption “Bypass Preconditioner Empty Time” to be displayed
                     on the Overview screen.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> stops the live bin agitator.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> waits for a time delay to expire that was started when the screw feeder stopped.
                     The length of this time delay was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial
                     installation and system startup. When this time delay expires, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> stops the flow of process water, process steam and all liquids to the preconditioner.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> waits for another time delay to expire that was started when the screw feeder stopped.
                     The length of this time delay was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial
                     installation and system startup. When this time delay expires, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> positions the downspout to the bypass position for about two seconds. The operator
                     can skip this delay at any time by clicking the “Bypass Preconditioner Empty Time”
                     button.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> stops the flow of process steam to the extruder.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> positions the downspout to the process position for about five seconds.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> positions the downspout to the bypass position for the remainder of the shutdown
                     sequence.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> places the knifehood diverter in the Reject position. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> ignores the signal from the knifehood diverter switch located near the extruder for
                     the remainder of the shutdown sequence.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> stops the preconditioner.

                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> waits for a time delay to expire that was started when the downspout was placed in
                     the Bypass position for the last time. The length of this time delay was configured
                     by the Wenger Technicians during initial installation and system startup. When this
                     time delay expires, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> stops the flow of process water to the extruder.

                     <p>During the shutdown sequence the operator can restart the extruder by clicking the
                        Start Extruder button on the Command Menu dialog box, up to the point when the downspout
                        is placed in the Bypass position for the first time. Thereafter, the operator must
                        wait for the shutdown sequence to conclude before starting the extruder again.  If
                        the operator chooses to restart the extruder during a shutdown, all required devices
                        will be set in the run mode immediately. There will not be any sequence associated
                        with this restart mode.

                     <p>After the extruder system is shutdown, the operator should set the knife disconnect

                        the knife drive shaft from the knife bearing assembly.
