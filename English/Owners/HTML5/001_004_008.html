               </h2> 
               <p>There is a short time interval following an extruder system shutdown during which
                  the extruder can be warm restarted. The warm restart sequence is shorter than the
                  normal startup sequence, and the extruder can be in operation sooner using this option.
                  However, <strong>NOTE</strong>: that if the Warm Restart Extruder button on the Command Menu dialog box is disabled,
                  the time during which this option is available has expired and the extruder must be
                  started using the normal startup sequence.
               </p> 
               <p>To initiate an <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>-managed extruder system warm restart, the operator brings up the Overview screen
                  on the control room <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console, clicks the (F5) Extruder Commands button, and on the Commands Menu dialog
                  box that appears, clicks the Warm Restart Extruder button. The sequence of operations
                  that the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> executes when the user chooses a warm startup of the extruder system are listed below
                  in the order that they take place.

                     <p>That this control scheme uses the gravimetric (loss-in-weight) rather than volumetric

               <ol>
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> causes the alarm horn to sound and the beacon to flash for about ten seconds to alert
                     all personnel that the extruder system is about to start. At the same time the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> displays the system status in the upper left corner of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor as “Extruder Running.”
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> places the downspout in the Bypass position.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the extruder's lubrication oil pump.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> fills the live bin with dry feed from the surge bin via the surge bin slide gate.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the live bin agitator.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> waits until the weight of dry feed in the live bin reaches a target weight value
                     that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial installation and system
                     startup. While the live bin fills the system status that is displayed in the upper
                     left corner of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor will be displayed as “Waiting for Live Bin to Fill.” <strong>NOTE</strong>: that the user can terminate waiting for the live bin to fill (although not recommended)
                     by clicking the “(F6) Bypass/Confirm Menu” button on the Overview screen, and on the
                     Bypass/Confirm Commands Menu dialog box that appears, clicking the Bypass Live Bin
                     Fill button. <strong>NOTE</strong>: also that during normal operation the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> automatically refills the live bin whenever the weight of dry feed material in the
                     live bin falls below a value that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during
                     initial installation and system startup.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables automatic control of the extruder barrel zone temperatures to pre-warm the
                     extruder barrel while the live bin is filling. Steam or cooling water is applied by
                     the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to each of the extruder barrel temperature control zones to attain the respective
                     setpoint temperatures. Throughout normal operation the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> continuously monitors and maintains the respective extruder barrel zone temperatures.
                     The respective extruder barrel zone temperatures are displayed, and the respective
                     setpoint changed, on the Barrel screen on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables process water to flow to the extruder, the magnitude being a percentage of
                     the dry feed rate, as per the formula extruder water setpoint loaded into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. <strong>NOTE</strong>: that this water is injected into the extruder; it is not water that is used for
                     extruder barrel temperature control. During startup, an extra amount of water is added,
                     as per the current formula value loaded into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. Once the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> considers the startup sequence to be complete it no longer adds this extra amount
                     of water to the extruder.
                  </li> 
                  <li>When the actual water flow rate to the extruder becomes greater than the extruder
                     water flow rate setpoint minus its alarm offset value, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the extruder motor at a speed that is 30 percent of the formula final extruder
                     speed setpoint. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will only start the extruder motor if it confirms the flow of lubrication oil. The
                     <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will terminate the normal startup sequence if lubrication oil flow is not confirmed
                     within a time period that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial
                     installation and system startup.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> attempts to confirm that the knifehood is in place and connected. If this is not
                     so an alarm will appear and the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will not proceed with the startup sequence until it is able to confirm that the knifehood
                     has been fastened together.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the knife, assuming that the operator has confirmed that the knife is safe
                     to start. The operator is first prompted to confirm that the knife is safe to start
                     earlier in this sequence when the screw feeder starts running. If the operator has
                     not confirmed that the knife is safe to start, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will wait until it receives confirmation.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the knife, and sets its speed to the formula knife speed setpoint. The operator
                     may increase or decrease the knife speed by changing the knife speed setpoint on the
                     Formula screen or by using the knife speed selector switch mounted on the knife stand
                     near the extruder. The knife speed will slowly ramp up or down if the selector switch
                     is held in the increase or decrease position, respectively. The knife speed will change
                     in small increments if the operator quickly rotates and releases the selector switch.
                  </li> 
                  <li>When the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> verifies that the extruder is running it starts the preconditioner in the forward
                     direction.
                  </li> 
                  <li>When the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> verifies that the preconditioner is running it starts the screw feeder. The dry feed
                     rate setpoint is unchanged from what it was before the warm restart sequence was initiated.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> places the downspout in the Extruder position (to channel mixed feed material from
                     the preconditioner outlet into the extruder inlet), and it increases the extruder
                     speed to the formula setpoint value.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables process steam to flow to the extruder, the magnitude being a percentage of
                     the dry feed rate, as per the formula extruder steam setpoint loaded into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>.

                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>'s warm restart sequence is concluded when the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> confirms that all extruder system devices are running, and that the flow rates for
