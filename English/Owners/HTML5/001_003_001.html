                     </h3> 
                     <p>This section addresses some of the Automated Process Management (<span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span>) software features that are common to many of the major <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> screens. First discussed are the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> header and status bar, two features that are visible regardless of which <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> screen is selected for display. Next discussed are the shapes that are commonly used
                        to represent various types of Wenger extruder system components, such as motors, valves,
                        pumps, etc. Also discussed are the graphical color conventions that are used to quickly
                        convey status information of the various extruder system components. Finally, there
                        is an extensive and detailed explanation of the various types of Hand-Off-Auto (<span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span>) faceplate’s that operators will frequently use to configure automatic control of
                        the extruder system by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. These classes of <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate’s are for fixed speed motors, variable speed motors, on/off valves, proportional
                        flow control valves, and temperature controllers.

                           of the extruder system. For example, when the extruder has completed its startup sequence
                           and is running, this region of the Header will display “Extruder Running”. When the
                           system is not running, or has completed its shutdown sequence, this region of the
                           Header will display “Extruder Stopped”. The beginning of specific key events in the
                           startup and shutdown sequence will be displayed during the startup and shutdown of
                           the system. Below the system status area is where information is displayed pertaining
                           to the formula presently used to control the extruder. Both formula name (3) and revision
                           (4) are displayed. Formulas will be discussed in later, <a href="001_003_008.html#id17AIFE00OYK">See Section 3.8, Formula Screen.</a>. Below the system status area is displayed the current date and time (5). The <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user account under which the user is currently logged in is displayed (6),
                           and the Wenger shop order number that was assigned to the customer's extruder system

                           are running or stopped) use a common color scheme to quickly communicate equipment
                           status to the operator, regardless of the type of equipment.

                           elements rather than process flows.) Colors only indicate the binary status (path
                           is open for flow vs path is closed to flow) of the equipment through which material
                           normally travels.

                     </h3> 
                     <div>
                        <p>A Hand-Off-Auto (<span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span>) or Proportional-Integral-Derivative (<span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span>) faceplate is a pop-up window (i.e., small faceplate) that appear when the operator
                           clicks an <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> or <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> button pertaining to a specific device. Each <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate presents the operator with options that he can choose that determine how
                           the corresponding extruder system device or condition is controlled by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. There is an <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate for each device and a <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate for each process flow or temperature that the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> controls. Most of these faceplate’s are accessible from the Extruder Overview screen.
                           (<a href="001_003_003.html#BABBFGJJF7">See Section 3.3, Extruder Overview Screen.</a>) Other faceplate’s are accessible from the Extruder Barrel Temperatures screen (<a href="001_003_004.html#BABBEEJFE0">See Section 3.4, Extruder Barrel Temperatures Screen.</a>), and from the Extruder Liquids 1 and Extruder Liquids 2 screens (<a href="001_003_005.html#id17AIF0F07Y4">See Section 3.5, Extruder Liquids 1 Screen.</a> and <a href="001_003_006.html#id17AIF5080HS">See Section 3.6, Extruder Liquids 2 Screen.</a>, respectively).
                        </p> 
                        <p>The options that a faceplate presents to the operator for device or condition control
                           depend on the nature of the device or condition being controlled. There are devices
                           that are driven by fixed-speed motors, so the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate’s for these will use the same template and will offer the same control
                           options. There are also variables speed motors, so the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate’s for these will offer the same control options. There are discrete position
                           gates for handling the flow of solid materials, so the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate’s for these will offer the similar control options. There are proportional
                           control valves for controlling the flow of liquids and vapors using flow <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control algorithms, all of which use a common <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate template. Lastly, there are proportional control valves for controlling
                           the flow of steam and cooling water using temperature <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control algorithms, all of which use a common <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate template.

Most fixed-speed motors are unidirectional, but
                           some are bidirectional. Examples of devices driven by fixed-speed motors are:

                           Hand, Off, or Auto.

                        <p>There are several gates that are part of the extruder system. These gates are discrete-position
                           devices, meaning that they can be commanded to either of two or three positions. Using
                           the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate for the corresponding gate, the operator can change the device's control
                           mode, and when in either the Hand or Off control mode, the operator can set the gate's
                           discrete position. These discrete positions are named differently on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate’s, depending on the gate. These devices are:
                        </p> 
                        <ul>
                           <li>Dry Feed Slide Gates</li> 
                           <li>Downspouts</li> 
                           <li>Back Pressure Valves (<span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span>)

                        </ul> 
                        <p>The dry feed slide gate is a two-position gate situated between the surge bin and
                           the live bin, and is used to refill the live bin with dry feed from the surge bin.
                           The slide gate has two discrete positions: completely open, which allows dry feed
                           to flow by gravity from the surge bin into the live bin, and completely closed, which
                           allows no dry feed to flow. Thus, the two positions for the slide gate are named Open
                           and Closed.
                        </p> 
                        <p>The downspout is a two-position gate situated between the preconditioner and the extruder
                           and is used to channel feed mixture that flows by gravity out of the preconditioner
                           into the extruder inlet. The downspout has two discrete positions: one position channels
                           the feed mixture from the preconditioner into the inlet of the extruder, while the
                           other position channels feed mixture from the preconditioner out of the extruder system
                           altogether (in which case it must be collected somehow or it will pile up on the production
                           facility floor). Thus, the two positions for the downspout are called Extruder and
                           Bypass.
                        </p> 
                        <p>The knifehood diverter is a two-position gate situated between the top of the knifehood
                           and the inlet of the processing equipment downstream of the extruder system, and is
                           used to allow extrudate slices to be sucked into the downstream processing system,
                           via negative pressure created by the downstream pneumatic product transfer equipment.
                           The knifehood diverter has two positions: completely open, which allows raw product
                           to travel downstream for further processing, and completely closed, in which case
                           the extrudate slices are rejected and fall out of the bottom of the knifehood (in
                           which case they must be collected somehow or they will pile up on the production facility
                           floor). Thus, the two positions for the knifehood diverter are called Process and
                           Reject.

                           either by varying a control valve position (as in the case for process water and steam
                           injected into the preconditioner and extruder), or by varying a metering pump speed
                           (as in the case of most customer-specific liquids such as oils, dyes, flavorings).
                           This same flow rate <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop, when placed in Manual control mode, maintains a constant control valve

                           at the expense of a constant liquid or vapor flow rate through the valve or pump,
                           which may vary with other conditions, such as upstream and downstream pressures.

                        <p>There are three parameters for a flow <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop that an operator can change using its <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate, these being the control loop's control mode, the flow rate setpoint (the
                           Auto control mode setpoint), and the control valve position or metering pump speed
                           (the Manual control mode setpoint). The flow rate setpoint can only be changed using
                           the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate when the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop is in Auto control mode, and the control valve position or metering
                           pump speed can only be changed using the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate when the control loop is in Manual control mode.

                           <p><strong>Manual Control Mode</strong> - Setting a flow <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop to Manual control mode instructs the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to maintain a constant control valve position (the degree to which it is open) or
                              metering pump speed. This desired valve position or pump speed is the manual setpoint,
                              expressed as a percentage that ranges from 0% (the valve is completely closed or the
                              pump is stopped) to 100% (the valve is completely open or the pump is running at its
                              maximum speed). Using the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate, the operator can enter the manual setpoint directly as a numerical value,
                              or he can ramp the setpoint up and down using the up or down arrow buttons, respectively.
                              The means of specifying the device's manual setpoint only appear on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate when the Manual control mode has been selected.

                           <p><strong>Auto Control Mode</strong> - Setting a flow <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop to Auto control mode instructs the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to maintain a constant flow rate of material, specifically mass flow rate. This desired
                              mass flow rate is calculated from the auto setpoint, which is expressed as a percentage
                              by weight of the dry feed rate. Thus, if the extruder steam auto setpoint is specified
                              as 10% of feed rate, and the dry feed rate is 1000 kg/hr, the extruder steam control
                              loop will attempt to maintain the extruder steam flow rate of 100 kg/hr. Using the
                              <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate, the operator can enter the auto setpoint directly as a numerical value,
                              or he can ramp the setpoint up and down using up or down arrow buttons, respectively.
                              The means of specifying the device's auto setpoint only appear on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate when the Auto control mode has been selected.

First, controlling the temperature of an extruder barrel zone requires
                           moderating both the flow of water for cooling and the flow of steam for heating. Thus,
                           varying the positions of two valves are necessary in temperature control, whereas
                           varying the position of only one valve or the speed of one pump is required in flow
                           control. Second, the valves for controlling steam or cooling water to the extruder
                           barrel jackets are on-off valves rather than proportional-position control valves.
                           For each of these valves, what is ultimately controlled is not valve position but
                           rather the ratio of time over a fixed time period, say ten seconds, that each valve
                           is completely open vs completely closed.

                        <p>A temperature <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop, when placed in Auto control mode, attempts to maintain a temperature
                           to match the desired temperature (i.e., the control loop's Auto control setpoint).
                           When in Auto control mode and the actual temperature is below the desired temperature,
                           the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> closes completely the cooling water valve while the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> varies the length of time during a fixed length time period that the steam valve
                           is completely open. When in Auto control mode and the actual temperature is above
                           the desired temperature, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> closes completely the steam valve while the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> varies the length of time during a fixed length time period that the cooling water

                           for the each of the two valves (derived from the control loop's Manual control setpoint),
                           thus allowing the temperature to vary with other conditions, such as steam and cooling
                           water upstream pressures or production rate changes.
                        </p> 
                        <p>There are a number of temperature <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loops that are used to control extruder system temperatures, depending on
                           the number of extruder barrel temperature zones that were provided with the customer's

                        <p>There are three parameters for a temperature <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop that an operator can change using its <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate, these being the control loops' control mode, the temperature setpoint
                           (the Auto control mode setpoint) and the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop output (the Manual control mode setpoint). The temperature setpoint
                           can only be changed using the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate when the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop is in Auto control mode, and the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop output can only be changed using the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate when the control loop is in Manual control mode. Using the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate the operator can switch between Auto and Manual control modes. There is
                           no Off control mode.

                        <blockquote>
                           <p><strong>Manual Control Mode </strong>- Setting a temperature <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop to Manual control mode instructs the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to maintain constant time-based ratios that the two control valves are open or closed.
                              This desired <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop output is the manual setpoint, expressed as a percentage that ranges
                              from 0% (maximum cooling) to 100% (maximum heating). A 50% manual setpoint corresponds
                              to no heating or cooling. Thus, when the manual setpoint is 0%, the cooling water
                              valve is open 100% of the time while the steam valve remains completely closed. When
                              the manual setpoint is 25%, the cooling water valve is open 50% of the time while
                              the steam valve remains completely closed. When the manual setpoint is 50%, both the
                              cooling water valve and the steam valve remain completely closed. When the manual
                              setpoint is 75%, the steam valve is open 50% of the time while the cooling water valve
                              remains completely closed. And finally, when the manual setpoint is 100%, the steam
                              valve is open 100% of the time while the cooling water valve remains completely closed.
                              Using the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate, the operator can enter the manual setpoint directly as a numerical value,
                              or he can ramp the setpoint up and down using the up or down arrow buttons, respectively.
                              The means of specifying the device's manual setpoint only appear on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate when the Manual control mode has been selected.
