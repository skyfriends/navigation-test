                  <p>Although the Extruder Liquids 2 screen is not a standard feature for all extruder
                     systems, it is discussed here since most customers have product formulations that
                     require at least one liquid other that water and steam. Examples of such liquids are
                     dyes and oils. This screen also displays the most important formula-specific operating
                     conditions on the right-side of the screen from which the corresponding setpoints
                     can also be changed.
                  </p> 
                  <p>If an Extruder Liquids 2 screen is provided, it is not accessible from the Main screen,
                     but rather by clicking an appropriately-labeled button at the bottom of the Extruder
                     Liquids 1 screen.

                  <p>An example of the Extruder Liquids 2 screen is reproduced in <a href="001_003_006.html#CHDJGACEA0">Figure 3.64</a>. This screen shows a <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop faceplate for five customer-specific liquids, ranging from liquid 1
                     on the left end to liquid 5 on the right end. For each liquid, there is a <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop faceplate, but also a graphic below the faceplate with which the operator
                     can monitor and control other liquid features. The aspects of this screen pertaining
                     to liquid 3 as an example and will be discussed below.

                     <li><strong>Liquid 3 </strong><span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span><strong> Control Loop Faceplate</strong> - This <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop faceplate for liquid 3, like the other four liquid faceplate’s, provides
                        the most status and control options concerning control loop behavior.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Liquid 3 Agitator Status/Control</strong> - This indicator and button allow the operator to monitor and control the liquid
                        3 tank agitator behavior. The agitator motor graphic color indicates the run status
                        of the agitator, where green indicates that the agitator is running, while blue indicates
                        that the agitator is not running. The text in the ellipse to the immediate right of
                        the motor graphic, which displays either “On” or “Off”, indicates the same thing.
                        The color inside the ellipse indicates the agitator's <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> control mode, white for Auto control, yellow for Hand (i.e., Manual) control, and
                        blue for Off.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Liquid 3 Tank Refill Status/Control</strong> - This indicator and button allow the operator to monitor and control the liquid
                        3 tank refill behavior. The text in the ellipse, which displays either “Refill” or
                        “Off”, indicates whether the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> is requesting that the tank be refilled (the customer is responsible for monitoring
                        this signal and refilling the tank when requested). The color inside the ellipse indicates
                        the agitator's <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> control status, white for Auto control, yellow for Hand (i.e., Manual) control, and
                        blue for Off.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Liquid 3 Pump Status/Control</strong> - This indicator and button allow the operator to monitor and control the liquid
                        3 tank pump behavior. The pump motor graphic color indicates the run status of the
                        pump, where green indicates that the pump is running, while blue indicates that the
                        pump is not running. The text in the ellipse to the immediate right of the motor graphic,
                        which displays either “On” or “Off”, indicates the same thing. The color inside the
                        ellipse indicates the pump's <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> control mode, white for Auto control, yellow for Hand (i.e., Manual) control, and
                        blue for Off.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Liquid 3 High Level Sensor Indicator</strong> - There are two liquid level indicators on the liquid 3 tank, one for indicating
                        high level and the other below for indicating low level. For each indicator, a green
                        color indicates that the liquid level in the tank is above the sensor, while a white
                        color indicates that the liquid level in tank is below the sensor.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Setpoints and Actual Values of Most Important Operating Conditions</strong> - This panel displays the setpoints and current values of the operating conditions
                        that are most crucial to the current product's formulation.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Navigating Buttons</strong> - Some screens, such as this one, provide buttons at the bottom of the screen that
                        allow the user to quickly switch to other screens without needing to go to the Main
                        screen first.

                  <p>For any of the five liquids in<a href="001_003_006.html#CHDJGACEA0">Figure 3.64</a>, clicking the button inside the tank causes an <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate to appear, from which the operator can change the tank's refill control
                     mode. Since refill are either On or Off the operator's only available control options
                     are selecting the agitator's control mode; there are no setpoint or speed control
                     parameters. The tank refill <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate is similar enough to the agitator <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_006.html#CHDGBGDEB9">Figure 3.66</a>, side [A], center [B], side [C] that they won't be discussed in detail.

                  <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop faceplate’s for the four liquids have identical functionalities. Each
                     faceplate allows the operator to place the corresponding flow rate <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop in either Auto control mode or Manual control mode. In Auto mode, the
                     <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> varies the respective pump speed to maintain a constant flow rate that is determined
                     from the setpoint. In Manual control mode, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> maintains the pump speed as per the operator's input. In <a href="001_003_006.html#CHDFGHIFI9">Figure 3.67</a>, side [A], the liquid 3 flow rate control loop is in Auto control mode, while in

                        be On or Off, but notice that the speed of the pump is still determined by the liquid

                     <li><strong>Flow </strong><span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span><strong> Control Loop Output</strong> - Since the pump is not running there is no liquid 3 flow. But the liquid 3 flow
                        <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop, which is still in Auto control mode and does not know whether the pump
                        is running, tries to increase the pump speed to increase the liquid 3 flow rate. It
                        eventually increases the pump speed command to its maximum 100%.
