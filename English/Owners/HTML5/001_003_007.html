                  </h3> 
                  <p>A trend is a graphical representation of changes to tag values over time. The trends
                     screen allows the user to view plots of tag values as they occur. The user can choose
                     for plotting from among a large collection of the more crucial tags. The user can
                     view tag data in real-time as they occur, or he can scroll back in time to view historical
                     data that was collected and saved days, weeks, and in some cases, months in the past.
                     Plotting values of more than one tag together on the same chart may provide the user
                     with insight into cause-and-effect relationships and is a valuable troubleshooting
                     tool.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The Trends screen is accessed by clicking the (F7) Trends button in the region of
                     the Main screen with the forest green background color. It can also be accessed from
                     any screen by pressing the F7 function key on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console keyboard.

                  <p>The Trends screen appears as shown in <a href="001_003_007.html#CHDJEECCG7">Figure 3.69</a>, where data related to control of the extruder's zone temperatures is being plotted.
                     Much of this screen is customizable by the user. For example, the chart background
                     color can be changed, as can the colors and line widths of the various tag traces.
                     Traces can appear superimposed on the same chart, or each tag can be plotted on its
                     own chart as they are stacked vertically. The operator can even select which tags
                     he wants to see plotted. The topic of customization will be discussed later on 
                     <xref style="color:red" idref="CHDJFIBJA3" format="Page"></xref>.

                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Tag Data Plots</strong> - Tag values are plotted as a series of data points connected by line segments. Each
                        tag has a default line color and width, but these can be changed by the user.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Tag Color and Range Legend</strong> - This legend (see detail in <a href="001_003_007.html#CHDIFEFCF4">Figure 3.70</a>) shows which trace colors are assigned to which tags, and provides the numerical
                        range for each tag trace. In this example the ranges are the same for all tags in
                        the group, but this is usually not the case.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Tag Current Values</strong> - This legend (see detail in <a href="001_003_007.html#CHDCIHIJF0">Figure 3.71</a>) displays the current value of each of the tags being plotted.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Horizontal Scroll Bar</strong> - The seven buttons on this scroll bar allow the user scroll backwards in time to
                        view tag data that has been scrolled off the chart to the left. The middle of the
                        seven scroll bar buttons allows the user to alternately pause and resume the plotting
                        of current tag data. When plotting of current data is paused the user can scroll back
                        and forth through past tag values. The button to the immediate left of the pause/continue
                        button allows the user to go backward in time, five minutes for each button click,
                        and display the traces for the tag data that were then collected and saved. The next
                        button over on the left allows the user to scroll backward in time in ten minute increments.
                        Clicking the left-most button will display traces for the oldest tag data retained
                        by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer; this data may be months old. The button to the immediate right of the pause/continue
                        button allows the user to go forward in time in five minute increments. The next button
                        over on the right allows the user to scroll forward in time in ten minute increments.
                        Clicking the right-most button returns the user to the present time as current data
                        will now be plotted.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Date/Time</strong> - These two fields, one near the top of the screen and one immediately above the
                        scroll bar buttons displays the date and time, respectively, for the data that is
                        currently plotted. The date is displayed at the top and the time is displayed just
                        above the scroll bar buttons.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Tag Groups</strong> - All the tags for which trends can be viewed are arranged in functional groups (e.g.,
                        extruder-related tags, liquids-related tags, temperature related tags). These buttons
                        allow the user to change the tag group currently enabled.
                     </li>

                  <p>If the operator right clicks anywhere on the trend screen's black background, a menu
                     appears with some useful options (see <a href="001_003_007.html#CHDCGCICG1">Figure 3.72</a>). Repeatedly clicking the Scroll option causes the trend to screen to alternately
                     pause and resume updating.

                  <p>A very useful customization tool available to the operator is the Properties faceplate
                     (see <a href="001_003_007.html#CHDJFIBJA3">Figure 3.73</a>), which can be brought forth by selecting Chart Properties menu option in <a href="001_003_007.html#CHDCGCICG1">Figure 3.72</a>.

                  <p>The operator will find that the options available on the Pens tab will be the ones
                     that he most frequently uses. With this tab the operator can change the visibility
                     of any of the traces on the plot, which is convenient with charts that are confusing
                     because so many traces are displayed at once. The operator can also change trace colors
                     and line weights and trace data ranges.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Other handy options are available on the Y-Axis tab, such as plotting all visible
                     traces on separate charts, rather than all on the same chart. On the X-Axis tab the
                     operator can specify a date and time from the past from which to retrieve and plot
                     data historical data that has been captured in the past and stored on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer's hard drive.
