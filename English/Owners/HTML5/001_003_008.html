                  <h3 id="d6e6573"><span class="chapter-number">3.8.1</span> Section Overview
                  </h3> 
                  <p>Formulas, also referred to as recipes, are collections of extruder system parameters
                     (e.g., operating condition setpoints, time intervals between the events in a sequence
                     of events, specifiers that determine how the extruder system is to be started up)
                     that a customer has determined are necessary to formulate the various products in
                     the customer's product line. The number of parameters that must be set to formulate
                     each product can be quite large. Thus, it is desirable to be able to specify each
                     collection of values just once, and store this collection of values in a formula file
                     on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> hard drive. Thereafter, when it is necessary to formulate a new batch of that product,
                     the necessary extruder system parameters can be retrieved from the corresponding formula
                     file on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer's hard drive and downloaded to the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> without the operator needing to manual specify them again. This saves time and minimizes
                     the possibility of human error.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The operator will manage formulas by using three screens, the Formula screen and the
                     Load Formula screen and the Edit/Add Formula screen, along with a handful of small
                     faceplates. Using these tools, the operator will be able to perform the following
                     formula-specific tasks:
                  </p> 
                  <ul>
                     <li>Create completely new formulas.</li> 
                     <li>Create new formulas from existing formulas.</li> 
                     <li>Modify existing formulas.</li> 
                     <li>Delete existing formulas.</li> 
                     <li>Create new formulas from current <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> setpoints.
                     </li> 
                     <li>Updating formula values with <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> setpoints.
                     </li> 
                     <li>Transfer formula values to the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to be used as the new setpoints.
                     </li>
                  </ul> 
                  <p>The formula data that is stored on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer's hard drive are stored in Microsoft SQL Server database files.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The Formula screen is accessed by clicking the (F8) Formula button in the region of
                     the Main screen with the forest green background color. It can also be accessed from
                     any screen by pressing the F8 function key on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console keyboard. The Load Formula screen is accessed from the Formula screen. The
                     Edit/Add Formula screen is accessed from the Load Formula screen.

                  </h3> 
                  <p>An example of the Formula screen is shown in <a href="001_003_008.html#CHDCDHEJC2">Figure 3.74</a>. There are three collections of values displayed on this screen:
                  </p> 
                  <ul>
                     <li>The selected formula data that have been retrieved from a selected SQL database formula
                        stored on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer's hard drive. This data is displayed in the two columns of data under the
                        “Formula Value” headers, and in the top left region of the screen with the dark blue
                        background color, under the header labeled “Selected Formula”. From the Formula screen,
                        this data can be loaded into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>'s memory, thus overwriting the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>'s current setpoint values.
                     </li> 
                     <li>The setpoint data that reside in the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>'s memory and are currently being used by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to control the extruder system. This data is displayed in the two columns of data
                        under the “<span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> Setpoint” headers, and in the top right region of the screen with the dark blue background
                        color, under the header labeled “<span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>”. From the Formula screen, this data can be saved to an existing or new formula database
                        file on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer's hard drive, or overwritten with the selected formula data.
                     </li> 
                     <li>Current operating conditions that result from the setpoint data used by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to control the extruder system. This constantly updated information is obtained by
                        the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> from the various input/output modules in the extruder system control panel, and is
                        displayed in the two columns of data under the “Actual Value” headers. Not all formula
                        parameters are setpoints, directly impacting current operating conditions. Thus, some
                        of the cells in the “Actual Value” columns are blank. This data is for information
                        only and is not stored in either a formula database file or in <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> memory.
                     </li>

                        use to overwrite the data in the currently selected formula database file stored an
                        <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer's hard drive with the setpoints currently residing in <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> memory.
