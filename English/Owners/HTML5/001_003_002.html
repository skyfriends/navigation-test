                  </h3> 
                  <p>This chapter will discuss the four rectangular color-coded regions of the Main screen
                     and the various buttons on the Main screen. The Main screen is the single top-level
                     screen in the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> hierarchy of screen. This is the screen that first appears after the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer boots up and begins executing the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software application. It provides the user with access to all second-tier screens.
                     The user can quickly return to the Main screen by pressing the Home key on the computer
                     keyboard or by clicking the “(Home) Main” button in the screen header with the mouse.

                  </h3> 
                  <p>The Main screen is divided into four regions (see <a href="001_003_002.html#CHDEEBIDI2">Figure 3.27</a>). Each region is colored to indicate that all the buttons residing within each respective
                     region share a common functionality at a higher level. The colors of the four colored
                     regions of the Main screen are:
                  </p> 
                  <ul>
                     <li><strong>“Forest Green</strong>” Color - indicating that all buttons in this region pertain to operation of the extruder
                        system.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>“Dark Yellow</strong>” Color - indicating that all buttons in this region pertain to operation of a dryer
                        system.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>“Lavender Blue</strong>” Color - indicating that all buttons in this region pertain to operation of a cooler/coater
                        system.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>“Gray” Color</strong> - indicating that all buttons in this region perform general purpose functions.
                     </li>
                  </ul>

                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Extruder System Buttons</strong> - The buttons in this region with the forest green background color allow the user
                        to call up screens that are generally related to managing the operation of the extruder
                        system. Some extruder system features are optional, and most customers will not purchase
                        an extruder systems with all the optional features. Seemingly random empty spaces
                        in the extruder system region are where buttons related to optional features not purchased
                        are hidden.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Dryer System Functions</strong> - The buttons in this region with the dark yellow background color allow the user
                        to call up screens that are generally related to managing the operation of the dryer
                        system. If a customer purchases a Wenger extruder system only, without an accompanying
                        dryer system, this region will be empty or very nearly empty of buttons. In addition,
                        some dryer system features are optional, in which case seemingly random empty spaces
                        in the region are where buttons related to optional features not purchased are hidden.
                        In <a href="001_003_002.html#CHDEEBIDI2">Figure 3.27</a>, it appears that the customer may have purchased a dryer from a different vendor
                        and only chose to buy dryer-related equipment from Wenger that allows him to measure
                        product bulk density and moisture.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Cooler/Coater System Functions</strong> - The buttons in this region with the lavender blue background color allow the user
                        to call up screens that are generally related to managing the operation of the cooler/coater
                        system. In <a href="001_003_002.html#CHDEEBIDI2">Figure 3.27</a>, it appears that the customer did not purchase a cooler/coater system.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>General Purpose Functions</strong> - The buttons in this region with the gray background color allow the user to call
                        up screens that are general in nature (not specific to the extruder, dryer, or cooler/coater)
                        or they are functions that are not available at the operator level. Buttons in this
                        region that are visible but disabled (do not respond to mouse clicks) are accessible
                        only to users who log in using an <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user account with higher privileges than what is allowed with the “Operator”
                        user account.
