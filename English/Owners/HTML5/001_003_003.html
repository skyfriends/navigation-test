                  </h3> 
                  <p>This section discusses the Extruder Overview screen. The operation of most of the
                     extruder system devices and conditions can be monitored and controlled from this screen.
                     For example, most of the extruder system devices with electrical drives can be monitored
                     and controlled from this screen. Many of the extruder system fluids flows can be monitored
                     and controlled from this screen. The operation of the various components that make
                     up the dry feed system are monitored and controlled from this screen. To make the
                     details of the Extruder Overview screen easier to grasped, the screen is explained
                     by dividing the screen down into a handful of functional areas:
                  </p>

                     <li>Feeder Section</li>

                  </ul> 
                  <p>The Extruder Overview screen is accessed by clicking the “(F1) Extruder Overview”
                     button in the region of the Main screen with the forest green background color. It
                     can also be accessed from any screen by pressing the F1 function key on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console keyboard.

                  </h3> 
                  <p>An example of the Extruder Overview screen after the extruder system has successfully
                     completed startup is reproduced in<a href="001_003_003.html#CHDGCFGFG0">Figure 3.32</a>. The green colors indicate devices that are currently in Running states. The flow
                     of material through the extruder system progresses from left to right. The customer
                     is responsible for always maintaining a sufficient level of dry feed material in the
                     Surge Bin (1) when the extruder system is in operation. The amount of dry feed material
                     in the Live Bin (2) is maintained by gravity flow of dry feed to the live bin from
                     the surge bin through a two-position gate called the Slide Gate (3) when the mass
                     of dry feed in the live bin drops below a minimum weight. The Screw Feeder (4) transfers
                     dry feed from the live bin to the Preconditioner (5) at a constant mass rate that
                     is specified by the customer. In the preconditioner, the dry feed is mixed with Preconditioner
                     Process Water (6), Preconditioner Process Steam (7), and any customer-specific liquids
                     (e.g., oils, dyes, flavorings) that are required by the customer's recipes to formulate
                     the product. (Note that the flow of customer-specific liquids is not shown on this
                     screen, but only on the liquid screens.) The feed mixture then flows into the extruder
                     through the two-position gate called the Downspout (8). The feed mixture is cooked
                     as both thermal and mechanical energy is added to it as it travels under high pressure
                     through the Extruder Barrel (9). The thermal energy is added by maintaining elevated
                     temperatures on the zones of the barrel (discussed in <a href="001_003_004.html#BABBEEJFE0">See Section 3.4, Extruder Barrel Temperatures Screen.</a>). The mechanical energy is added by maintaining high pressures inside the extruder
                     barrel, in part with the design of the extruder barrel internal screw, and in part
                     with the Back Pressure Valve (<span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span>) (12). In addition, while the feed mixture is being cooked inside the extruder barrel,
                     Extruder Process Water (10) and Extruder Process Steam (11) is added to the feed mixture
                     as called for by the product recipe. As the cooked raw product is forced out through
                     the end of the extruder barrel and shaped by the extruder dies, it is sliced into
                     kibbles with a Knife (13) rotating at high speeds. These product kibbles are then
                     pulled through the Knife Hood (14) to equipment downstream of the extruder system
                     via a negative pressure pneumatic product transfer system. An Indicator (15) of the
                     status of the downstream processing equipment, whether it is ready to receive raw
                     product from the extruder system, is provided.
                  </p> 
                  <p>On the top of the Extruder Overview screen are some objects that will be discussed
                     in detail <a href="001_003_003.html#CIHCCCJHD5">See Section 3.3.5, Extruder Section.</a>. There are two Buttons (16) and (17) that bring forward faceplatees that provide
                     options for extruder system control such as starting, stopping and flushing the extruder
                     system. There is a Button (18) that commands all extruder system devices to their
                     Auto control modes. There is a Faceplate (19) that provides status and control options
                     for operation of the dry feed system. And there is a faceplate (20) that displays
                     dry feed totals and energy statistics.
                  </p> 
                  <p>At the bottom of the Extruder Overview screen is a bank of Buttons (21) that allow
                     the operator to quickly change to another of the most commonly used screens

                     <p>The feeder section consists of the surge bin, the live bin, and the screw feeder (see
                        <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDECHGJG2">Figure 3.33</a>). The feeder section can be operated in either of two mode: gravimetric (based on
                        weight) or volumetric. Most customers will prefer operating in gravimetric mode since
                        it is the more accurate of the two.

                     <p>The live bin is refilled when signaled by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. How the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> determines when to issue the live bin refill signal depends on whether the feeder

                     <p>When the feeder section is being operated in gravimetric mode, the level of dry feed
                        material in the live bin is determined from the input from the live bin load cells
                        which measure the weight of the material inside it. The volume of dry feed material
                        in the live bin is calculated by applying the known dry feed density specified as
                        a parameter in the currently loaded formula. Finally, the level of dry feed material
                        in the live bin is calculated by applying the known volume and dimensions of the cylindrically-shaped
                        live bin. The two live bin level sensors indicate when the level of dry feed material
                        in the live bin is above and below each level, respectively.

                     <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> issues an output signal to open the surge bin slide gate to fill the live bin when
                        the live bin weight drops below a predetermined value. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> monitors the weight increase in the live bin as the live bin is refilling. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> issues an output to close the surge bin slide gate when the live bin weight reaches
                        a predetermined value. Note that the live bin will always fill to a weight slightly
                        greater than the weight value calculated to close the surge bin slide gate because
                        of the in-transit inventory of material between the surge bin slide gate and the material
                        level in the live bin.

                        based on input from the live bin high level sensor. If the live bin high level sensor

                        The surge bin slide gate is opened and the live bin is filled until the high-level

                  <p>The preconditioner section is where dry feed material is mixed with process steam,
                     process water, and any customer-specific liquids (e.g., oils, dyes, flavorings) before
                     the mixture flows down to the extruder inlet through the downspout (see <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDEGDFIC9">Figure 3.37</a>). This section includes the preconditioner, the downspout, and the equipment necessary
                     for controlling the flow of preconditioner process water and process steam.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Wenger provides three varieties of preconditioners:</p> 
                  <ul>
                     <li>Differential Diameter Conditioner (<span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span>)

                  </ul> 
                  <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span> features two mixer shafts. These mixer shafts rotate at different speeds but are
                     driven by a single constant-speed motor (one shaft rotates at the motor's speed while
                     the other is linked to the motor through a fixed-ratio gear reducer). The two <span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span> mixer shafts rotate at fixed speeds that the operator cannot change. When the <span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span> is in the Auto control mode the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> always determines the rotation directions of the two shafts. But the operator can
                     override the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and select the direction of rotation (forward or reverse) for the two mixer shafts
                     by setting the <span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span> to Hand control mode (clicking the <span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span> <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> button (1) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDEGDFIC9">Figure 3.37</a>), and then clicking either the Forward or Reverse direction buttons on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span> <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDCECIAB3">Figure 3.38</a>.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">HIP</span> features two mixer shafts. Each of these two mixer shafts is driven by its own dedicated
                     motor. The speed that each mixer shaft rotates is independent of the speed of the
                     other shaft, and the rotational speed of each mixer shaft is selectable by the operator.
                     Similarly, the direction that each mixer shaft rotates is independent of the direction
                     of the other shaft, and the direction of each mixer shaft is selectable by the operator.
                     The speed and direction of each mixer shaft can be specified by the operator in Hand
                     control mode via an <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate, and can be specified by formula parameters in Auto control mode.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">HSC</span> features a single mixer shaft that rotates in the forward direction only, but the
                     speed that the mixer shaft rotates is selectable by the operator in Hand control mode
                     via an <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate, and can be specified by a formula parameter in Auto control mode.
                  </p> 
                  <p>From this point on in this document only the operation of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">DDC</span> type of preconditioner will be discussed.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The preconditioner process water and process steam flow rates each depend in Auto
                     control mode on the recipe for the specific product being formulated, and are each
                     usually specified as a percentage of the dry feed rate. When the process water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop is in the Auto control mode the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> always determines the process water flow rate. The operator can change the process
                     water Auto control mode flow rate setpoint by clicking the Water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> button (2) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDEGDFIC9">Figure 3.37</a>), and then changing the value in the setpoint text box (4) in the Cylinder Water

                     also override the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and set the process water flow control valve to a specific position by clicking the
                     Water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> button (2) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDEGDFIC9">Figure 3.37</a>), setting the process water flow to Manual control mode and then changing the value
                     in the percent output text box (5) of the Cylinder Water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDEGEBJA7">Figure 3.39</a>. The same holds for changing the process steam flow control valve position.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The downspout is a two-position gate that either channels feed mixture into the extruder
                     inlet or bypasses the extruder (in which case feed mixture material will fall to the
                     shop floor unless there is a means of collecting it ready to be used). The downspout
                     can be commanded to either of two states, the Extruder state or the Bypass state,
                     these names reflecting the respective positions. When the downspout is in the Auto
                     control mode the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> always determines the position of the downspout. But the operator can override the
                     <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and specify the downspout position by setting the downspout to Hand control mode
                     (clicking the Downspout <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> button (3) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDEGDFIC9">Figure 3.37</a>), and then clicking either Extruder or Bypass buttons on the Downspout <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> Faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDFGBEFF3">Figure 3.40</a>.

                  <p>The extruder section is where the feed mixture is cooked under high pressure. This
                     section includes the extruder, the lube pump, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span>, and the process water and process steam that are injected into the extruder barrel
                     (not to be confused with the water and steam that are circulated through the extruder
                     barrel jackets and used to control the temperatures of the various extruder barrel
                     temperature zones). <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJEGIHF9">Figure 3.41</a> reproduces the region of the Extruder Overview screen where the extruder section
                     can be seen.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The extruder motor only rotates in the forward direction. Its speed is usually specified
                     in RPM as a formula item in Auto control mode that depends on the recipe for whatever
                     product is being produced. When the extruder is in the Auto control mode the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> always determines the extruder speed. But the operator can override the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and specify the extruder speed by setting the extruder to Hand control mode (clicking
                     the Extruder <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> button (1) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJEGIHF9">Figure 3.41</a>), and then changing the value in the manual setpoint text box (10) on the Extruder
                     <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDICIFHE9">Figure 3.43</a>.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The lube pump is a fixed speed device that circulates lubrication oil through the
                     extruder motor bearing housing. The lube pump must be running before the extruder
                     motor can be started. When the lube pump is in the Auto control mode the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> always determines whether the lube pump is running or stopped. But the operator can
                     override the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and control the lube pump by clicking the Lube Pump <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> button (2) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJEGIHF9">Figure 3.41</a>, and then clicking either Hand (4) or Off (5) buttons on the Lube Pump <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDGBHCJI2">Figure 3.44</a>.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The extruder process water and process steam flow rates each depend in Auto control
                     mode on the recipe for the specific product being formulated, and each are usually
                     specified as a percentage of the dry feed rate. When the extruder process water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop is in the Auto control mode the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> always determines the process water flow rate. The operator can change the process
                     water Auto control mode flow rate setpoint by clicking the Water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> button (4) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJEGIHF9">Figure 3.41</a>), and then changing the value in the setpoint text box (4) on the Extruder Water
                     <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDDBBGDG4">Figure 3.45</a>. Changing the extruder process steam setpoint is done in the same fashion. The operator
                     can also override the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and set the extruder process water flow control valve to a specific position by clicking
                     the Water <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> button (4) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJEGIHF9">Figure 3.41</a>), setting the process water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop to Manual control mode and then changing the value in the percent output
                     text box (5) of the Extruder Water <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJEGIHF9">Figure 3.41</a>. The same holds for changing the extruder process steam flow control valve position.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> is a valve that has a single inlet and two outlets. One outlet, called the process
                     outlet, channels raw product material from the extruder through a shaping die and
                     then on to the knife. The other outlet, called the reject outlet, channels material
                     down through an opening at the bottom of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> and out of the extruder system (where a container should be in place to collect the
                     rejected raw product). The <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> can be controlled in either of three states: Process, Reject and Die Relief. When
                     the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> is commanded to the Process state the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> allows raw product to flow from the extruder through the valve's process outlet,
                     the size of which can be enlarged or restricted to maintain a desired pressure at
                     the end of the extruder. When the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> is commanded to the Reject state the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> allows raw product to flow from the extruder through the valve's reject outlet. When
                     the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> is commanded to the Die Relief state the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> allows raw product to flow from the extruder to both the process outlet and reject
                     outlet. In addition, the size of the process outlet opening is set to its maximum.
                     When the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> is in the Auto control mode the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> always determines whether the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> is in the Process, Reject or Die Relief control mode. But the operator can override
                     the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and control the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> by clicking the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> button (3) in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJEGIHF9">Figure 3.41</a>, and then clicking either Hand (4) or Off (5) buttons in the <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJJJGHH0">Figure 3.46</a>.

                  <h3 id="d6e4942"><span class="chapter-number">3.3.6</span> Knife Section
                  </h3> 
                  <p>The knife section is where the raw product that is forced under pressure out of the
                     extruder section through shaping die is then cut to length and conveyed out of the
                     extruder system. This section includes the knife and the knife hood. <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDJCGGJE6">Figure 3.47</a> reproduces the region of the Extruder Overview screen where the knife section can
                     be seen.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The knife speed is usually specified in RPM as a formula item that depends on the
                     recipe for whatever product is being produced. The knife hood is a channel or ductwork
                     through which the product is pneumatically conveyed to equipment downstream of the
                     extruder system, usually a dryer, for further processing. Typically, there is a product
                     transfer fan and airlock downstream of the extruder system that, when the knife hood
                     diverter is open, creates a pressure drop sufficient to pull the product through the
                     knife hood and over to the downstream equipment. This negative pressure is not exerted
                     on the knife hood when the knife hood diverter is closed. In this case, any raw product
                     exiting the extruder and cut by the knife will fall out through the bottom of the
                     knife hood. (The product transfer fan and airlock are sometimes provided as the last
                     section of the extruder system, but they are more typically the first section of a
                     dryer system, and so they won't be addressed in this document.)

                  <p>The Extruder Commands faceplate is shown in <a href="001_003_003.html#CHDBIEDCJ2">Figure 3.55</a>. It features a group of buttons with which the operator can instruct the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to supervise and handle the details of starting up and shutting down the extruder
                     system. As an example, when the operator clicks the Start Extruder button the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will be instructed to execute a normal startup of the extruder system. This is a
                     sequence of steps, starting with ensuring that the surge bin is filled with dry feed
                     material and ending with opening the knife hood diverter to allow raw product to be
                     conveyed to processing equipment downstream of the extruder system. The normal startup
                     sequence ensures that each motor is started up at the proper time, that the flow of
                     water and steam begin flowing at the proper time and at the specified rates, that
                     the extruder barrel zones are controlled at the specified temperatures, and that the
                     downspout, <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> and knife hood gates are positioned when the necessary conditions are satisfied.
                     When any abnormal conditions are encountered during the sequence a corresponding operator
                     alarm is triggered. These automated sequences allow for optimal, consistent, repeatable
                     extruder system operation, minimize human error, and relieve operators of the responsibility
                     of executing the required sequence steps. All <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> supervised startup and shutdown sequences are described in detail in <a href="001_001_001.html#BABGEFBCG0">General Information</a>.
