               <p>The alarms that are listed in <a href="001_005_006.html#id17ADE8020UI">Table 5.4</a>,  are annunciation-only alarms; they do not cause the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to shutdown the extruder system. Each alarm that is listed below is assigned a number
                  for reference only (it does not reflect any priority, severity, or importance). For
                  each alarm listed below there is its reference alarm number, the text that appears
                  on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor (the reference number is displayed along with the text), the most probable
                  cause of the alarm, and some troubleshooting tips on <a href="001_005_006.html#id17ADE8020UI">Table 5.4</a>.
