                  </h3> 
                  <p>The Extruder Barrel Temperatures screen displays the measured temperature, both numerically
                     and graphically, of each of the extruder barrel temperature zone control loops. For
                     each zone, it indicates if the respective temperature is within or outside of normal
                     range. It also allows the operator to bring up a faceplate for each zone that he can
                     use to change the zone's temperature setpoint or change the zone temperature control
                     zone.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The Extruder Barrel Temperatures screen is accessed by clicking the (F3) Barrel Screen
                     button in the region of the Main screen with the forest green background color. It
                     can also be accessed from any screen by pressing the F3 function key on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console keyboard.

                  </h3> 
                  <p>An example of the Extruder Barrel Temperature screen is reproduced in <a href="001_003_004.html#CHDDBJBJF6">Figure 3.57</a>. This screen shows the actual temperature and temperature setpoint for five barrel
                     temperature control zones, labelled simply as Zone 1 through Zone 5.1. It also displays
                     the downspout temperature, but no temperature setpoint, since there is no downspout
                     temperature control loop. In the upper part of the screen, the five zone temperatures
                     and the downspout temperature are displayed with bar graphs, while slightly below
                     that the actual temperatures and the temperature setpoints are displayed numerically.
                     Below the extruder barrel image are graphical indicators of the status of each zone,
                     regarding whether the zone is being heated with steam, cooled with water, or neither.
                     A button is provided for each control zone that, when clicked, will bring up an <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate that allows the operator to manipulate the control loop for that zone.

                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Downspout Temperature</strong> - The downspout temperature is always left-most, displayed as a bar graph in the
                        region with the dark blue background color, and below that, but above the barrel image,
                        as a numerical value in white text.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Zone 1 Temperature</strong> - To the right of the downspout temperature is the extruder zone 1 temperature, similarly
                        displayed both graphically and in text.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Zone 5 Temperature</strong> - The last zone temperature is displayed right-most, both graphically and in text.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Temperature Setpoints</strong> - This row displays the five zone temperature setpoints, in black text and white
                        background color. For any of the five zones clicking on the white rectangle brings
                        up a faceplate that allows the operator to enter a new temperature setpoint.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Current Temperatures</strong> - This row displays the five zone temperatures plus the downspout temperature, in
                        white text.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>“Zone 1</strong> <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span><strong>” Button</strong>- Clicking this button will cause the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate for temperature control zone 1 to appear.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Extruder Motor Load</strong></li> 
                     <li><strong>Extruder Head Pressure</strong></li> 
                     <li><strong>Shortcuts to Other Most Commonly Used Screens</strong> - This row of buttons allows the user to quickly switch to a few of the most commonly
                        used screens without having to switch to the Main screen first.

                  <p>The fill colors of the bar graphs for the various zone temperatures in the upper region
                     of the screen indicate whether the respective temperatures are within normal range
                     or are out of bounds.

                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Zone 3 Temperature</strong> - In this example, the red bar graph fill color indicates that the current Zone 3
                        temperature is too high (i.e., it is greater than the sum of the Zone 3 temperature
                        setpoint plus the Zone 3 temperature offset formula value).
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Zone 4 Temperature</strong> - In this example, the blue bar graph fill color indicates that the current Zone
                        4 temperature is too low (i.e., it is less than the difference of the Zone 3 temperature
                        setpoint minus the Zone 4 temperature offset formula value).
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Zone 5 Temperature</strong> - In this example, the gray bar graph fill color indicates that the current Zone
                        5 temperature is with normal range (i.e., close enough to the Zone 5 temperature setpoint
                        that the difference is less than the Zone 5 temperature offset formula value).
                     </li>
                  </ol> 
                  <p>The fill colors for the graphics representing conduits for flow of steam and water
                     to the extruder temperature control zone jackets indicate whether the respective flow
                     control valves are open or closed.

                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Temperature Zone Being Cooled</strong> - When the fill color of a water control valve and the conduit between the valve
                        and the extruder is blue, this indicates that the water control valve is open and
                        that the zone is being cooled.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Temperature Zone Not Being Cooled</strong> - When the fill color of a water control valve and the conduit between the valve
                        and the extruder is gray, this indicates that the water control valve is closed and
                        that the zone is not being cooled.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Temperature Zone Being Heated</strong> - When the fill color of a steam control valve and the conduit between the valve
                        and the extruder is white, this indicates that the steam control valve is open and
                        that the zone is being heated.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Temperature Zone Not Being Heated</strong> - When the fill color of a steam control valve and the conduit between the valve
                        and the extruder is gray, this indicates that the steam control valve is closed and

                  <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control <span class="acronym" translate="no">HOA</span> faceplate for each barrel temperature zone can be accessed by clicking the control
                     valve button for that zone below the extruder barrel graphic. For any particular zone
                     the operator can switch between letting the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> control the zone temperature with a <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop, and controlling the water and steam control valve manually himself.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In <a href="001_003_004.html#CHDBJGIFE8">Figure 3.60</a>, side [A], the zone 1 temperature control loop is in Auto control mode (1). Notice
                     that the operator can change the temperature setpoint by either clicking inside where
                     the setpoint value is displayed in black text with white background color near the
                     bottom of the faceplate or by clicking either of the up or down arrow buttons. Notice
                     also that the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> controls the movement of the vertical slider on the left side of the faceplate to
                     indicate the relative magnitudes of water and steam flows to the zone jacket. The
                     operator can switch between control modes by first clicking Edit button (2).
                  </p> 
                  <p>In <a href="001_003_004.html#CHDBJGIFE8">Figure 3.60</a>, center [B], the operator can switch the zone 1 temperature control loop to Manual
                     control mode by clicking the Man button (3) followed by the Hide button (4).
                  </p> 
                  <p>In <a href="001_003_004.html#CHDBJGIFE8">Figure 3.60</a>, side [C], the zone 1 temperature control loop is now in Manual control mode (5).
                     Notice that the operator can still change the temperature setpoint, but the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> ignores it until the loop is set back to Auto control mode. Notice also that the
                     operator can now control the movement of the vertical slider on the left side of the
                     faceplate change rather than just indicate the relative magnitudes of water and steam
                     flows to the zone jacket. Finally, notice that the operator can specify the relative
                     magnitudes of water and steam flows to the zone jacket with some text entry box and
                     two new arrow buttons near the bottom of the faceplate that are not visible when the
                     loop is in Auto control mode.
