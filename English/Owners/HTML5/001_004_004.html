               </h2> 
               <p>To initiate a <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>-managed extruder system normal startup, the operator brings up the Overview screen
                  on the control room <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console, clicks the “(F5) Extruder Commands” button, and on the Commands Menu dialog
                  box that appears, clicks the Start Extruder button. The sequence of operations that
                  the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> executes when the user chooses a normal startup of the extruder system are listed
                  below in the order that they take place.
               </p> 
               <div class="alert">

                  <div class="alert-statement"><span class="note"></span>  
                     <p>that this control scheme uses the gravimetric (loss in weight) mode of feeder control,
                        which is the default and preferred mode, rather than the volumetric mode.

               <ol>
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> causes the alarm horn to sound and the beacon to flash for about ten seconds to alert
                     all personnel that the extruder system is about to start. At the same time the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> displays the system status in the upper left corner of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor as “Starting Extruder.”
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> positions the downspout between the preconditioner outlet and the extruder inlet
                     in the bypass position.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the extruder's lubrication oil pump.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> fills the live bin with dry feed from the surge bin via the surge bin slide gate.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the live bin agitator.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> waits until the weight of dry feed in the live bin reaches a target weight value
                     that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial installation and system
                     startup. While the live bin fills the system status that is displayed in the upper
                     left corner of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor will be displayed as “Waiting for Live Bin to Fill.” <strong>NOTE</strong>: that the user can terminate waiting for the live bin to fill (although not recommended)
                     by clicking the (F6) Bypass/Confirm Menu button on the Overview screen, and on the
                     Bypass/Confirm Commands Menu dialog box that appears, clicking the Bypass Live Bin
                     Fill button. <strong>NOTE</strong>: also that during normal operation the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> automatically refills the live bin whenever the weight of dry feed material in the
                     live bin falls below a value that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during
                     initial installation and system startup.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables automatic control of the extruder barrel zone temperatures to prewarm the
                     extruder barrel while the live bin is filling. Steam or cooling water is applied by
                     the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to each of the extruder barrel temperature control zones to attain the respective
                     setpoint temperatures. Throughout normal operation the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> continuously monitors and maintains the respective extruder barrel zone temperatures.
                     The respective extruder barrel zone temperatures are displayed, and the respective
                     setpoint changed, on the Barrel screen on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the preconditioner in the forward direction.
                  </li> 
                  <li>When the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> verifies that the preconditioner is running it starts the screw feeder. Initially
                     for a short time, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> calculates the feeder speed from the current formula's dry feed bulk density, startup
                     feed rate, and feed rate setpoint. But in short order, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> uses live bin loss in weight to determine the feeder speed.
                  </li> 
                  <li>As soon as the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> confirms that the screw feeder is running it displays the Confirm Knife ready button
                     on the Overview screen a button above, below or adjacent to the knife. At the same
                     time the system status that is displayed in the upper left corner of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor will be displayed as “Waiting for Knife Confirmation.” When the user is certain
                     that it is safe for the knife to start, he clicks the Confirm Knife Ready button,
                     at which point the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the knife.
                  </li> 
                  <li>After the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> verifies that the screw feeder is running, and after a time delay (which may be zero)
                     that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial installation and system
                     startup, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables both steam and water flow to the preconditioner, the magnitude of each being
                     a respective percentage of the dry feed rate, as per the current formula values loaded
                     into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. Water is injected into the preconditioner through a bank of spray nozzles. These
                     spray nozzles ensure a uniform distribution of water at all flow rates. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> selects the water nozzle(s) appropriate given the current water flow rate setpoint.
                     These nozzles are automatically switched on and off by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> as needed throughout the extruder system's operation.
                  </li> 
                  <li>After the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> verifies that the screw feeder is running, and after a time delay (which may be zero)
                     that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial installation and system
                     startup, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables all liquids to flow to the preconditioner, the magnitude of each being a
                     respective percentage of the dry feed rate, as per the current formula values loaded
                     into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. As with water, product-specific liquids may be injected into the preconditioner
                     through spray nozzles. <strong>NOTE</strong>: that the number of liquids that are used is customer and product dependent. Some
                     customers have products with formulations that require multiple liquids, while other
                     customers have products that require no liquids (other than water).
                  </li> 
                  <li>When the actual water flow rate to the preconditioner becomes greater than the preconditioner
                     water flow rate setpoint minus its alarm offset value, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> begins a time delay to allow the preconditioner to fill with sufficiently mixed material.
                     During this time delay the system status that is displayed in the upper left corner
                     of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor will be displayed as “Waiting for Cylinder to Fill.” At the same time, a
                     “Bypass Preconditioner Fill Time” button will appear and remain on the Overview screen
                     until the preconditioner fill time delay counts down to zero. The operator can terminate
                     the preconditioner fill time delay and cause the normal startup sequence to proceed
                     to the next step by clicking this button. This is useful if the normal startup began
                     with premixed material already in the preconditioner.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables process water to flow to the extruder, the magnitude being a percentage of
                     the dry feed rate, as per the current formula value loaded into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. <strong>NOTE</strong>: that this water is injected into the extruder; it is not water that is used for
                     extruder barrel temperature control. During startup, an extra amount of water is added,
                     as per the current formula value loaded into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. Once the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> considers the startup sequence to be complete it no longer adds this extra amount
                     of water to the extruder.
                  </li> 
                  <li>When the actual water flow rate to the extruder becomes greater than the extruder
                     water flow rate setpoint minus its alarm offset value, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the extruder motor at a speed that is 30 percent of the formula final extruder
                     speed setpoint. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will only start the extruder motor if it confirms the flow of lubrication oil. The
                     <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will terminate the normal startup sequence if lubrication oil flow is not confirmed
                     within a time interval that was configured by the Wenger Technicians during initial
                     installation and system startup.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> enables process steam to flow to the extruder, the magnitude being a percentage of
                     the dry feed rate, as per the current formula value loaded into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>. <strong>NOTE</strong>: that this steam is injected into the extruder; it is not steam that is used for
                     extruder barrel temperature control.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> waits for a time delay to expire that was started when the extruder motor was started.
                     When the time delay expires, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> sets the downspout position to channel mixed feed material from the preconditioner
                     outlet into the extruder inlet.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> attempts to confirm that the knifehood is in place and connected. If this is not
                     so an alarm will appear and the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will not proceed with the startup sequence until it has confirmed that the knifehood
                     has been fastened together.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the knife, assuming that the operator has confirmed that the knife is safe
                     to start. The operator is first prompted to confirm that the knife is safe to start
                     earlier in this sequence when the screw feeder starts running. If the operator has
                     not confirmed that the knife is safe to start, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> will wait until it receives confirmation.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> starts the knife, and sets its speed to the formula knife speed setpoint. The operator
                     may increase or decrease the knife speed by changing the knife speed setpoint on the
                     Formula screen or by using the knife speed selector switch mounted on the knife stand
                     near the extruder. The knife speed will slowly ramp up or down if the selector switch
                     is held in the increase or decrease position, respectively. The knife speed will change
                     in small increments if the operator quickly rotates and releases the selector switch.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> ramps the dry feed rate setpoint from the formula startup feed rate setpoint to the
                     formula normal operation dry feed rate setpoint.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> waits for a time delay to expire that was started when the downspout was positioned
                     to channel mixed feed material to the extruder inlet. When the time delay expires
                     the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> no longer adds extra startup process water to the extruder.
                  </li> 
                  <li>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>'s normal startup sequence is concluded when the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> confirms that all extruder system devices are running, and that the flow rates for
                     all product ingredients (dry feed, water, steam, liquids) reach have attained their
