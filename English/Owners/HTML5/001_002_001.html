It describes the different Windows and <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user accounts that exist, how to boot up the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer, how to get the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> application software running, how to switch among the different levels of <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> user types, and for <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> systems that were developed for customers in Non-English speaking CE countries, how
                        to switch the language that the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software uses to display text between English and the customer's local language.

                     <p>For the reader to avoid being confused by the following sub-paragraphs, he should
                        understand that two types of user accounts will be discussed. The first type are the
                        Windows operating system user accounts, of which there are two, and the second type
                        are the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user accounts, of which there are four. Note that the names of the two Windows
                        user accounts are also used as names for two of the four <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> user accounts.

                     </h3>
                     <p>On every <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> computer that is delivered to a customer, Wenger has created the following two user
                        accounts at the Windows operating system level:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Operator</li>
                        <li>Wenger</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>The “Wenger” Windows user account is password-protected but the “Operator” Windows
                        user account is not. Only Wenger personnel know the “Wenger” Windows user account
                        password, so no non-Wenger personnel will be able to login to Windows using the “Wenger”
                        user account. It will be necessary for all customer personnel, regardless of whether
                        they are operators, maintenance personnel, or supervisors, to login to Windows using
                        the “Operator” Windows user account, but since this Windows user account is not password-protected,
                        the user will not be prompted for a password.
                     </p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                     <h3 id="d6e882"><span class="chapter-number">2.1.3</span> <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> Software User Accounts
                     </h3>
                     <p>At the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> application software level, Wenger has created the following four user accounts:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Operator</li>
                        <li>Maintenance</li>
                        <li>Supervisor</li>
                        <li>Wenger</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>These four <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user accounts provide the users with differing levels of <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software privileges. The “Operator” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> user type is the most restrictive. The “Maintenance” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> user account is slightly less restrictive. The “Supervisor” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> user account is much less restrictive. And finally, the “Wenger” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> user account has no restrictions associated with it. Note that the Maintenance, Supervisor
                        and Wenger user accounts at the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software level are password protected, while the Operator user account is not password-protected.
                     </p>
                     <p>Due to the potential for confusion, it will be stressed here again. The “Operator”
                        and “Wenger” user accounts that have been defined at the Windows operating system
                        level should not be confused with the “Operator”, “Maintenance”, “Supervisor” and
                        “Wenger” user accounts that have been defined at the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> application software level.
                     </p>
                     <p>All customer personnel must login to Windows using the “Operator” Windows user account.
                        When this happens, and after the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software starts up, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software automatically logs the customer into the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software using the “Operator” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> application software's Operator user account. But using the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software, customer personnel can switch to either of the less restrictive Maintenance
                        or Supervisor types (if they know the respective user type passwords). This will be
                        described in detail below

                     </h3>
                     <p>When the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HMI</span> computer is first powered up it boots up with whatever version of the Windows operating
                        system has been installed on the computer. When bootup is complete, Windows prompts
                        the user to login to Windows. There are two types of Windows user accounts that are
                        available for selection, “Operator” and “Wenger” (see <a href="001_002_001.html#CJHIIHAEF0">Figure 2.1</a>).

                        <li><strong>Operator</strong> - Clicking this icon will cause the user to be logged in to Windows without being
                           prompted for a Windows user password.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Wenger</strong> - Clicking this icon will cause the user to be logged in to Windows only after he
                           supplies the password for the “Wenger” Windows user account.
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>When the user logs in to Windows using the “Operator” Windows user account, Windows
                        will automatically start up the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> application software (which may require up to a minute to completely start up and
                        begin running), and automatically login the user at the “Operator” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software level.
                     </p>
                     <p>When startup is complete the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software's Main screen will appear (see <a href="001_002_001.html#CJHDHBHHF9">Figure 2.2</a>). The various features of this Main screen will be explained in detail in a later
                        chapter, but for now notice that four of the buttons (1), (2), (3) and (4) in the
                        lower region of the screen are disabled. That is because users at the “Operator” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software level are restricted from accessing these features. These buttons, however,
                        are all enabled for users at the “Wenger” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software level.

                     </h3>
                     <p>As already stated, the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software recognizes the following four <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user accounts in ascending order of security levels and privileges:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Operator</li>
                        <li>Maintenance</li>
                        <li>Supervisor</li>
                        <li>Wenger</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>As an example, the “Supervisor” <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user account allows the user to modify the various <span class="acronym" translate="no">PID</span> control loop tuning values, something not permitted by the “Operator” or “Maintenance”
                        <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user accounts. When the customer's operators are logged in and using the
                        <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software to control the extruder system, occasionally customer personnel with more
                        expansive user privileges may want to use the <span class="acronym" translate="no">HMI</span> for a short time. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software allows for doing this by providing the “(csL) Log On” button in the lower
                        right region on the Main screen (see <a href="001_002_001.html#CJHCGHBFE5">Figure 2.4</a>). When this button is clicked, the FactoryTalk View SE Client Login dialog box appears
                        with which the user can switch to a <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user level with more privileges, by specifying a different <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> software user account in the “User name” text box and the associated password in
                        the “Password” text box.
