                  </h3> 
                  <p>The Print Data Sheet screen displays what are generally considered the most important
                     operating conditions related to product quality and, when printed, allow the operator
                     to have a hard-copy record of the current production run. The Print Data Sheet screen
                     is accessed by clicking the Print Data Sheet button in the region of the Main screen
                     with the gray background color.

                  </h3> 
                  <p>An example of the “Print Data” sheet screen, which is tailored to each customer's
                     extruder system, is shown in <a href="001_003_014.html#CHDCBEDFA5">Figure 3.104</a>. In the top left corner of the screen the current date/time, user type and formula
                     identifier are displayed, and an empty field is provided where a “run number” may
                     be written on the printed data sheet if desired. The two buttons in the top right
                     corner of the screen will allow the operator to “print” the screen and “exit” the
                     screen, respectively.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Below the upper horizontal separator line but above the lower horizontal separator
                     line, some of the operating conditions typically considered most vital to the formulation
                     of products are displayed. First is a block of text pertaining to the dry feed: its
                     density, rate of consumption, and screw feeder speed. Below that appears another block
                     of text pertaining to the rates of consumption of the raw materials mixed with the
                     dry feed in the preconditioner: process water, process steam, and recipe-specific
                     liquids. Below that appears another block of text pertaining to the preconditioner,
                     specifically the rates of consumption of the ingredients that are mixed with the dry
                     feed in the preconditioner: process water, process steam, and recipe-specific liquids.
                     Below that appears another block of text pertaining to the extruder, rates of consumption
                     of process water and process steam injected into the extruder barrel, zone temperatures,
                     extruder speed and motor load, <span class="acronym" translate="no">BPV</span> position and even knife speed.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Below the lower horizontal separator are a handful of empty fields where the operator
                     may manually record on the printed data sheet information pertaining to the raw product
                     that many customers find helpful for future reference. This data includes raw product
                     density and moisture

                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>“Run Number”</strong> - This empty field is proved so that the operator can hand write a value on a printed
                        hard copy of this data sheet.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>“Print” Button</strong> - Clicking this button causes that data sheet to be printed, proved the APM computer
                        is connected to a printer, and that Windows has been configured to recognize that
                        printer.
                     </li> 
                     <li>“<strong>Exit” Button</strong> - Clicking this button returns the operator to the main screen.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Important Operating Conditions</strong> - This group of parameters are read and displayed by the APM software. These values
                        will reflect the current operating conditions at the moment when the data sheet was
                        printed.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Other Important Operating Conditions</strong> - This group of empty fields is provided so that the operator can hand-write values
                        for operating conditions that are considered of interest to most customers.
                     </li>
