                  <p>The Alarm Log Viewer screen displays the alarms that have occurred during the most
                     recent 24-hour period. It is useful for troubleshooting problems with causes that
                     aren't readily apparent. The Alarm Log Viewer screen is accessed by clicking the Alarm
                     Log Viewer button in the region of the Main screen with the gray background color.

                  </h3> 
                  <p>An example of a portion of an alarm log is reproduced in <a href="001_003_012.html#CHDEEIBED3">Figure 3.101</a>. Most alarms will make three different appearances in the alarm log. When an alarm
                     is first logged as active but before it can be acknowledged by the operator, it is
                     listed as an entry in the alarm log with a large red bell icon in the left-most column,
                     and the date/time that the alarm became active in the adjacent column. Then, as what
                     usually happens, when it is acknowledged while the underlying cause is still active,
                     it is listed a second time, with a small red bell and black checkmark icon in the
                     left-most column, and the date/time that the alarm was acknowledged in the adjacent
                     column. Finally, when the underlying condition for the alarm disappears, it is listed
                     a third time, with a small blue bell and black checkmark icon in the left-most column,
                     and the date/time that the alarm condition was resolved in the adjacent column.

                  <p>Therefore, referring to the first column in <a href="001_003_012.html#CHDEEIBED3">Figure 3.101</a>, the three events related to the downspout disconnected alarm are:
                  </p> 
                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Active, Unacknowledged Downspout Disconnected Alarm.</strong></li> 
                     <li><strong>Active, Acknowledged Downspout Disconnected Alarm.</strong></li> 
                     <li><strong>Resolved, Acknowledged Downspout Disconnected Alarm.</strong></li>
                  </ol> 
                  <p>Several features of the Alarm Log Viewer screen that are important to be aware of,
                     are listed with <a href="001_003_012.html#CHDBIJHEE3">Figure 3.102</a>:
                  </p>

                     </figcaption> <img src="../../../images/APM_Screens_Figure_102.png"></figure> 
                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>“Language Filter Options” Dropdown</strong> - For <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> systems that were delivered with language switching capability, this feature allows
                        the user to see alarm messages only in the local language, only in English, or in
                        both.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>“Refresh” Button</strong> - When the Alarm Log Viewer screen is selected from the Main screen it displays all
                        alarm log entries up to the moment that the screen appears. The viewer does not refresh
                        itself as new alarm events occur. To do that the operator must click the Refresh button.
