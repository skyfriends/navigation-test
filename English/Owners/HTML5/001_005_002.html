               </h2> 
               <p>All currently active alarms are always displayed in a field in the top right corner
                  of the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> monitor <a href="001_005_002.html#BABICFJAF5">Figure 5.1</a>, regardless of which screen is selected. This field only displays the three most
                  recent active alarms, so there may be more than three. To view all active alarms,
                  select to view the Alarm Summary screen (as shown in <a href="001_003_011.html#id17AIFG00JPN">Alarm Summary Screen</a> ). The most recently occurring active alarms are displayed at the top (the header
                  region) above each screen, and as more alarms occur, older active alarms are displayed
                  below the more recent active alarms, and may even disappear from this field, even
                  though they are still active. In both the header region at the top of the monitor,
                  and on the Alarm Summary screen, unacknowledged alarms are shown in red text, while
                  acknowledged alarms are shown in yellow text.
               </p> 
               <figure id="BABICFJAF5">
                  <figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 5.1</span> Active Alarms 
                  </figcaption> <img src="../../../images/Alarms_Figure_01.png"> 
                  <ol class="legend-list">
                     <li class="legend-item">Active Unacknowledged Alarms</li> 
                     <li class="legend-item">Active Acknowledged Alarm</li>
                  </ol>
               </figure> 
               <p>Acknowledged alarms only remain displayed in the list of active alarms if the condition
                  causing the alarm remains in force. Acknowledged alarms disappear from the display
                  of active alarms if the conditions that caused them are no longer true. It should
                  be noted that if an abnormal condition arises that triggers an alarm, and if that
                  condition were to revert to normal before the alarm is acknowledged, the alarm for
                  the original abnormal condition that no longer exists will continue to be displayed
                  in red text until the operator acknowledges it, at which point the alarm will disappear
                  from the displayed list of active alarms.
               </p> 
               <p>If there are no currently unacknowledged active alarms (those in red text) and a new
                  alarm appears, the amber alert beacon on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console will flash, and if the new alarm is considered critical the alert horn will
                  sound until the operator acknowledges all currently unacknowledged active alarms.
                  The operator can do so by pressing the End key on the console keyboard at any time,
                  regardless of which screen is currently being displayed. The alarm horn, which can
                  be very annoying, can be silenced by pressing the Horn Silence button on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console.
               </p> 
               <p>For a system as complex as a Wenger Extruder System it should not be surprising that
                  there are many potential abnormal conditions that have been identified, indeed hundreds,
                  for which alarms have been defined. These alarms have been classified as to severity
                  and consequence, and then placed into one of four categories in regards to criticality:
               </p> 
               <ul>
                  <li>Immediate shutdown alarms (most critical). Any of the alarms in this category will
                     cause the Programmable Logic Controller (<span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span>) to execute an immediate extruder system shutdown. What constitutes an immediate
                     shutdown is discussed in <a href="001_001_001.html#BABGEFBCG0">General Information</a>. See <a href="001_005_003.html#BABHDDHHA2">Immediate Shutdown Alarms</a> for a list of common immediate shutdown alarms.
                  </li> 
                  <li>Quick shutdown alarms. Any of the alarms in this category will cause the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to execute a quick extruder system shutdown. What constitutes a quick shutdown is
                     discussed in <a href="001_001_001.html#BABGEFBCG0">General Information</a>. See <a href="001_005_004.html#BABGEDBDC8">Quick Shutdown Alarms</a> for a listing of common quick shutdown alarms.
                  </li> 
                  <li>Normal shutdown alarms. Any of the alarms in this category will cause the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> to execute a normal extruder system shutdown. What constitutes a normal shutdown
                     is discussed in <a href="001_001_001.html#BABGEFBCG0">General Information</a>. See <a href="001_005_005.html#BABFHFCCJ8">Normal Shutdown Alarms</a> for a listing of common normal shutdown alarms.
                  </li> 
                  <li>Annunciation only alarms (least critical). These alarms are for information only.
                     Although none such alarms directly shutdown the extruder system, a condition that
                     causes one of these alarms to occur may also later lead to one of the above shutdown
                     alarms occurring. See <a href="001_005_005.html#BABFHFCCJ8">Normal Shutdown Alarms</a> for a list of common normal shutdown alarms.
