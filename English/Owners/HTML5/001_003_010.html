                  </h3> 
                  <p>Wenger recommends that customers perform certain reoccurring maintenance operations
                     on their extruder systems to extend the operational life of the equipment and to minimize
                     repair and replace costs. Such maintenance tasks include things like lubricating moving
                     parts, cleaning filters, and changing oil. The Extruder Maintenance screen is intended
                     to alert operators and maintenance personnel when extruder system scheduled maintenance
                     tasks need to be completed, based on a running total of hours of extruder system operation.
                     The Extruder Maintenance screen is accessed by clicking the “(F12) Maintenance” button
                     in the region of the Main screen with the forest green background color. It can also
                     be accessed from any screen by pressing the “F12” function key on the <span class="acronym" translate="no">APM</span> console keyboard.

                  </h3> 
                  <p>The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> that controls the extruder system machinery maintains a running total of hours that
                     the extruder system is in operation. The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> uses this number to maintain a running total of the number of hours until each of
                     certain routine scheduled maintenance tasks need to be performed. Some tasks can be
                     performed by either operators or maintenance personnel, while other tasks are to be
                     performed only by maintenance personnel.
                  </p> 
                  <p>An example of the Extruder Maintenance screen is reproduced in <a href="001_003_010.html#CHDBFECHA8">Figure 3.96</a>. This is how the screen would look when the extruder system is started up at the
                     customer's facility for the first time by the Wenger Service Team. It is also how
                     it appears when a user has logged in who has a security level higher than the Operator
                     user type.

                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Extruder Hours</strong> - This is the running total of the number of hours that the extruder has been running
                        since it was commissioned by the Wenger Service Team, 7501 hours in the example above.
                        The <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> accumulates time only when the extruder motor is in the running state.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Hours Until Maintenance Indicators</strong> - This column of numbers, each of which is maintained by the <span class="acronym" translate="no">PLC</span> and counts down only while the extruder motor is running, shows the total number
                        of operational hours remaining until the corresponding scheduled maintenance task
                        should be performed. In <a href="001_003_010.html#CHDBFECHA8">Figure 3.96</a>, the task at the top of the list will need to be performed after four more hours
                        of extruder operation.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>“Reset” Buttons</strong> - When it is time for a maintenance task to be performed the background color of
                        the button associated with that task will change to red. Clicking any of the buttons
                        in this column resets the corresponding hours-until-maintenance value to the left
                        of the button to its maximum value.
                     </li> 
                     <li><strong>Maintenance Instructions</strong> - There are many small rectangular and circular maintenance instruction prompts displayed
                        on the screen. When it is time for a maintenance task to be performed the background
                        color of the prompt associated with that task will change to red. Hovering the mouse
                        over any of these small rectangular/circular prompts causes the maintenance instructions
                        associated with the associated equipment to be displayed, as in <a href="001_003_010.html#CHDJBAIDH8">Figure 3.98</a>.
